# Chirp It Up, Full Stack Style!
The purpose of this lab is to take your chirpr schema, connect it to your Chirper Half Stack app, and utilize the database instead of chirpsstore.ts or chirps.json!

## Required Steps
### Database
1. Create a database user named chirprapp
2. Grant all privileges to your chirpr database.
Hint: use chirpr.* in the ON part of the GRANT statement.
### Node
1. In your chirpr API, use your database to store chirps instead of a file
2. Install and save the mysql @types/mysql NodeJS package using NPM
3. Configure your connection using createConnection
4. In each API method, make the appropriate database call to create, read, update, and delete chirps
5. Test all the REST API endpoints in Postman to confirm they all work
### React
1. Adjust your frontend React components to use the same API endpoints from above to achieve the same functionality it had reading a json file. It should display all chirps, view one chirp, delete or edit that, and the ability to add new chirps.
## Advanced Steps
1. Create a table named Mentions with the following fields/columns, if you don't have one already:
```
Mentions
  userid
  chirpid
  ```
2. Create a stored procedure named spUserMentions that returns all chirps a user is mentioned in
* Parameters: userid
* The result set should contain: chirpid, chip text, chirp date
* Tip: be sure to insert some fake mentions so that you can test the procedure!
3. When a chirp is created, check to see if there are mentions in the chirp text and add it to the database
* Mentions should be put in chirps with the format @username.
* Example Chirp: hi @matt it was good to see you in class!
4. If it does, add a mention to the database as well as the chirp
* Create a new API method that inserts mentions
* Hint: You'll have to parse the string and lookup the user by name (use like!)
* If you don't have a username on your table, you can use userid (i.e. @1 instead of @matt)
5. Add the ability in your app to click a username and view all of the chirps that user is mentioned in
* Create a new API method that retrieves chirps that a user is mentioned in
* Important: There is some creativity that will be needed on your part to put a good interface together that works for this!
